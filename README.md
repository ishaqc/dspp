## **Key Modules and Projects**

### **1. Data Infrastructure and Tools**

**Objective**: Understand the strengths and constraints of data ecosystems in a professional environment.

#### **Key Project: Understanding Data Ecosystems**
- Analysed the data landscape at **C. Hoare & Co. Bank**.
- Identified challenges in data infrastructure and proposed improvements to optimise workflows.
- Highlighted the bankâ€™s use of **SQL databases**, **Power BI**, and **Excel** for operational data management.

---

### **2. Data Engineering**

**Objective**: Build ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines to automate data processing and ensure data quality.

#### **Key Project: Faster Payments Reconciliation**
- **Task**: Automate reconciliation between **NatWest bank statements** and internal ledger entries.
- **Tools**: SQL (Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server), Power BI.
- **Steps**:  
   - Built an **ETL pipeline** to extract data from two distinct sources.  
   - Applied **data cleansing** (removing duplicates, handling nulls, normalising formats).  
   - Loaded reconciled data into Power BI for real-time visualisation.  
- **Impact**: Reduced reconciliation time by **40%**, improved compliance, and enhanced decision-making.

### **3. Data Visualisation and Dashboards**

**Objective**: Present data in intuitive, interactive formats to aid data-driven decisions.

#### **Key Project: Customer Joining Team Dashboard**
- **Task**: Automate monthly reporting for the Customer Joining Team.
- **Tools**: Power BI, Excel.
- **Highlights**:  
   - Built an interactive dashboard to track key metrics like customer acquisition rates and onboarding timelines.  
   - Designed drill-through features to allow granular analysis.  
- **Impact**: Enabled management to make faster, data-driven decisions while improving operational efficiency.

### **4. Data Analytics**

**Objective**: Apply statistical and machine learning techniques to uncover insights and build predictive models.

#### **Project 1: Luxury Loan Portfolio Analysis**
- **Data Source**: Kaggle (Luxury Loan Dataset).  
- **Tools**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn).  
- **Analysis**:  
   - Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) to identify patterns and relationships.  
   - Built a **Logistic Regression Model** to predict loan defaults.  
- **Outcome**: Identified key predictors like loan amount and income, enabling better risk management.

#### **Project 2: Customer Churn Prediction**
- **Objective**: Predict customer churn using logistic regression.  
- **Tools**: Python, Excel.  
- **Steps**:  
   - Conducted **EDA** and visualisations (histograms, box plots).  
   - Developed a logistic regression model to analyse churn factors.  
- **Outcome**: Key insights revealed that **customer tenure** and **balance** significantly influence churn rates. Recommendations provided to reduce churn.
