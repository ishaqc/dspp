# Customer Churn Prediction

## Objective  
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the banking sector. By identifying customers at risk of leaving, the bank can take proactive measures to improve retention rates.

## Tools & Techniques  
- **Tools**: Python, Excel  
- **Techniques**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Logistic Regression, Data Visualisation  

## Process  
1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Cleaned and pre-processed customer data to remove duplicates and missing entries.  
   - Key variables included customer tenure, account balance, estimated salary, and product usage.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Analysed the distribution of variables like **tenure** and **balance** to identify patterns.  
   - Visualised trends using histograms and boxplots.  

3. **Model Development**:  
   - Built a **Logistic Regression** model to classify customers as churn or not churn.  
   - Measured performance using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, and **recall**.

## Results  
- **Tenure** and **balance** were identified as the most influential factors driving churn.  
- Customers with shorter tenure and lower account balances are more likely to churn.  

## Key Insights  
- The model successfully predicted churn with high accuracy.  
- Visualisations highlighted key segments of customers at risk, allowing targeted retention efforts.

## Recommendations  
1. Focus on retaining customers with **shorter tenure** by offering loyalty incentives or targeted communication.  
2. Monitor and engage customers with **low balances** to understand their needs and reduce churn risk.  
3. Enhance predictive capabilities by incorporating additional features such as transaction behaviour or customer feedback.
